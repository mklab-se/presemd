# No Transition
Instant cut between slides

# Why None?

- Zero latency between slides
- Best for rapid navigation
- No animation overhead

# Code Example

```rust
fn none() {
    // Just swap. No animation needed.
}
```

## Summary

The none transition instantly swaps slides with no animation.
Navigate forward and backward to see the instant cut.
